# pyubx

A bunch of python utilities to make automating verilog (and VHDL) easier

## Getting Started

Clone the repo to get the scripts, callable utilities are at the top level and include
1. make_wrapper
2. verilog_utiles

### Prerequisites

The idea here is that this should be a self contained lib without needing anything else installed


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
git clone https://github.com/padraig.ryan/pyubx
```

## Running the tests

There's some regression tests available. To run regression:
```
make
```


### And coding style tests

Uses 4 spaces and tries to be PEP-8 compliant
