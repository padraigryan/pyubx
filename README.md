# pyubx

A bunch of python utilities to make automating verilog (and VHDL) easier. Separated to provide the functionality in importable modules to be extended/customised

## Getting Started

Clone the repo to get the scripts, callable utilities are at the top level and include:

* make_wrapper
* verilog_utiles

### Prerequisites

The idea here is that this should be a self contained lib without needing anything else installed... so there's none.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running


```
git clone https://github.com/padraig.ryan/pyubx
```

## Running the tests

There's some regression tests available. To run regression:
```
make
```


### And coding style tests

Uses 4 spaces and tries to be PEP-8 compliant

## Still To Do:

* Create a utils for each of the types

# rtl_utils.py
# vcd_utils.py
# phy_utils.py
# hal_utils.py
* Should this include all the little tools?
** Alternatively have the tools in <type>_<tool>.py?

### Top level Utils
#### rtl_utils
* More VHDL support
#### vcd_utils
*
#### phy_utils
#### hal_utils
#### Verilog Utils
*

### Importable modules
